                  A set of common keys MAY be defined by the API in the future. To avoid

                  TargetRefs identifies an API object to apply the policy to.
                  Only Services have Extended support. Implementations MAY support
                  additional objects, with Implementation Specific support.
                  Note that this config applies to the entire referenced resource
                  by default, but this default may change in the future to provide
                  a more granular application of the policy.

                  TargetRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different targets. If this is the case, then targetRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all targetRef entries in the BackendTLSPolicy.
                  * They select different sectionNames in the same target.

                  When more than one BackendTLSPolicy selects the same target and
                  sectionName, implementations MUST determine precedence using the
                  following criteria, continuing on ties:

                  * The older policy by creation timestamp takes precedence. For
                    example, a policy with a creation timestamp of "2021-07-15
                    01:02:03" MUST be given precedence over a policy with a
                    creation timestamp of "2021-07-15 01:02:04".
                  * The policy appearing first in alphabetical order by {name}.
                    For example, a policy named `bar` is given precedence over a
                    policy named `baz`.

                  For any BackendTLSPolicy that does not take precedence, the
                  implementation MUST ensure the `Accepted` Condition is set to
                  `status: False`, with Reason `Conflicted`.

                      validate a TLS handshake between the Gateway and backend Pod.

                      If CACertificateRefs is empty or unspecified, then WellKnownCACertificates must be
                      specified. Only one of CACertificateRefs or WellKnownCACertificates may be specified,
                      not both. If CACertificateRefs is empty or unspecified, the configuration for
                      WellKnownCACertificates MUST be honored instead if supported by the implementation.

                      A CACertificateRef is invalid if:

                      * It refers to a resource that cannot be resolved (e.g., the referenced resource
                        does not exist) or is misconfigured (e.g., a ConfigMap does not contain a key
                        named `ca.crt`). In this case, the Reason must be set to `InvalidCACertificateRef`
                        and the Message of the Condition must indicate which reference is invalid and why.

                      * It refers to an unknown or unsupported kind of resource. In this case, the Reason
                        must be set to `InvalidKind` and the Message of the Condition must explain which
                        kind of resource is unknown or unsupported.

                      * It refers to a resource in another namespace. This may change in future
                        spec updates.

                      Implementations MAY choose to perform further validation of the certificate
                      content (e.g., checking expiry or enforcing specific formats). In such cases,
                      an implementation-specific Reason and Message must be set for the invalid reference.

                      In all cases, the implementation MUST ensure the `ResolvedRefs` Condition on
                      the BackendTLSPolicy is set to `status: False`, with a Reason and Message
                      that indicate the cause of the error. Connections using an invalid
                      CACertificateRef MUST fail, and the client MUST receive an HTTP 5xx error
                      response. If ALL CACertificateRefs are invalid, the implementation MUST also
                      ensure the `Accepted` Condition on the BackendTLSPolicy is set to
                      `status: False`, with a Reason `NoValidCACertificate`.

                      A single CACertificateRef to a Kubernetes ConfigMap kind has "Core" support.
                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching multiple certificates to
                      a backend, but this behavior is implementation-specific.

                      Support: Core - An optional single reference to a Kubernetes ConfigMap,
                      with the CA certificate in a key named `ca.crt`.

                      of resources, or a single reference that includes multiple certificates.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                  Only Services have Extended support. Implementations MAY support
                  additional objects, with Implementation Specific support.
                  Note that this config applies to the entire referenced resource
                  by default, but this default may change in the future to provide
                  a more granular application of the policy.

                  TargetRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different targets. If this is the case, then targetRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all targetRef entries in the BackendTLSPolicy.
                  * They select different sectionNames in the same target.

                  When more than one BackendTLSPolicy selects the same target and
                  sectionName, implementations MUST determine precedence using the
                  following criteria, continuing on ties:

                  * The older policy by creation timestamp takes precedence. For
                    example, a policy with a creation timestamp of "2021-07-15
                    01:02:03" MUST be given precedence over a policy with a
                    creation timestamp of "2021-07-15 01:02:04".
                  * The policy appearing first in alphabetical order by {name}.
                    For example, a policy named `bar` is given precedence over a
                    policy named `baz`.

                  For any BackendTLSPolicy that does not take precedence, the
                  implementation MUST ensure the `Accepted` Condition is set to
                  `status: False`, with Reason `Conflicted`.

                        must be set to `InvalidKind` and the Message of the Condition must explain which
                        kind of resource is unknown or unsupported.

                      * It refers to a resource in another namespace. This may change in future
                        spec updates.

                      Implementations MAY choose to perform further validation of the certificate
                      content (e.g., checking expiry or enforcing specific formats). In such cases,
                      an implementation-specific Reason and Message must be set for the invalid reference.

                      In all cases, the implementation MUST ensure the `ResolvedRefs` Condition on
                      the BackendTLSPolicy is set to `status: False`, with a Reason and Message
                      that indicate the cause of the error. Connections using an invalid
                      CACertificateRef MUST fail, and the client MUST receive an HTTP 5xx error
                      response. If ALL CACertificateRefs are invalid, the implementation MUST also
                      ensure the `Accepted` Condition on the BackendTLSPolicy is set to
                      `status: False`, with a Reason `NoValidCACertificate`.

                      A single CACertificateRef to a Kubernetes ConfigMap kind has "Core" support.
                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching multiple certificates to
                      a backend, but this behavior is implementation-specific.

                      Support: Core - An optional single reference to a Kubernetes ConfigMap,
                      with the CA certificate in a key named `ca.crt`.

                      of resources, or a single reference that includes multiple certificates.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.
                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

          GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
          Gateway resources.

          It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
          means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
          was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
          propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
          limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
          If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
          Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.

          Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
          add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
          associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
          Gateway is not deleted while in use.

          GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

                  controller does not require any additional configuration.

                  ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap,
                  or an implementation-specific custom resource. The resource can be
                  cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped.

                  If the referent cannot be found, refers to an unsupported kind, or when
                  the data within that resource is malformed, the GatewayClass SHOULD be
                  rejected with the "Accepted" status condition set to "False" and an
                  "InvalidParameters" reason.

                  A Gateway for this GatewayClass may provide its own `parametersRef`. When both are specified,
                  the merging behavior is implementation specific.
                  It is generally recommended that GatewayClass provides defaults that can be overridden by a Gateway.

          GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
          Gateway resources.

          It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
          means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
          was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
          propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
          limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
          If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
          Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.

          Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
          add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
          associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
          Gateway is not deleted while in use.

          GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

                  other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
                  be sent to.

                  If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                  Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                  set of Addresses.

                  The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                  it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                  GatewayStatus.Addresses.

                  Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define
                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.

                  ## Distinct Listeners

                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                  exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                  "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                  apply in that case).

                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.

                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
                  they support:

                  HTTPRoute

                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided

                  TLSRoute

                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough

                  "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:

                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                  Listener**.

                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                  Listener fields.

                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                  values for other fields.

                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                  Gateway API spec.

                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:

                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port

                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                  implementation:

                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                    Listeners, and
                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                    Protocol.

                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.

                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                  accepted.

                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.

                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname

                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.

                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                  matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                  `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.

                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                  For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.

                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.

                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                  the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                  `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.

                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners

                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                  condition in the Listener Status to "True".

                  The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                  purpose of this documentation.

                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                  no Conflicted Listeners.

                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                  the following rules:

                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.

                  The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.

                  ## General Listener behavior

                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                  For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                  request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                  to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).

                  This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.

                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                  conformance tests.

                  ## Compatible Listeners

                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:

                  1. They are distinct.
                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                     addresses.

                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                  may not be compatible for another.

                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.

                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria:

                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                          a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                          a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                          example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

                        All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                        implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                        the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                        support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                        example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                        of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                        Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                        define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                        field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                        matching.

                        Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                        the following protocols:

                        * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                        * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                        * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match both the SNI and Host header.
                          Note that this does not require the SNI and Host header to be the same.
                          The semantics of this are described in more detail below.

                        To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                        implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                        hostnames within the application protocol.

                        Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                        reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                        status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                        request because it appears to have been misdirected.

                        To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                        the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                        Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:

                        * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                          the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                        * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                          does not match the Host:
                            * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                              421.
                            * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                              404.

                        For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                        `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                        there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                        accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                        documentation.

                        Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                        as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                        both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                              AnnotationValue is the value of an annotation in Gateway API. This is used
                              for validation of maps such as TLS options. This roughly matches Kubernetes
                              annotation validation, although the length validation in that case is based
                              on the entire size of the annotations struct.

                            Options are a list of key/value pairs to enable extended TLS
                            configuration for each implementation. For example, configuring the
                            minimum TLS version or supported cipher suites.

                            A set of common keys MAY be defined by the API in the future. To avoid
                            any ambiguity, implementation-specific definitions MUST use
                            domain-prefixed names, such as `example.com/my-custom-option`.
                            Un-prefixed names are reserved for key names defined by Gateway API.

                        Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                        combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                        and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                        a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                        AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                        resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                        attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                        Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                        successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                        for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                        attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.

                  Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                  set of Addresses.

                  it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in

                      ParametersRef is a reference to a resource that contains the configuration
                      parameters corresponding to the Gateway. This is optional if the
                      controller does not require any additional configuration.

                      This follows the same semantics as GatewayClass's `parametersRef`, but on a per-Gateway basis

                      The Gateway's GatewayClass may provide its own `parametersRef`. When both are specified,
                      the merging behavior is implementation specific.
                      It is generally recommended that GatewayClass provides defaults that can be overridden by a Gateway.

                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.

                  ## Distinct Listeners

                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                  exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                  "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                  apply in that case).

                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.

                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
                  they support:

                  HTTPRoute

                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided

                  TLSRoute

                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough

                  "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:

                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                  Listener**.

                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                  Listener fields.

                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                  values for other fields.

                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                  Gateway API spec.

                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:

                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port

                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                  implementation:

                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                    Listeners, and
                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                    Protocol.

                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.

                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                  accepted.

                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.

                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname

                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.

                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                  matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                  `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.

                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                  For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.

                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.

                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                  the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                  `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.

                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners

                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                  condition in the Listener Status to "True".

                  The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                  purpose of this documentation.

                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                  no Conflicted Listeners.

                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                  the following rules:

                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.

                  The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.

                  ## General Listener behavior

                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                  For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                  request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                  to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).

                  This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.

                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                  conformance tests.

                  ## Compatible Listeners

                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:

                  1. They are distinct.
                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                     addresses.

                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                  may not be compatible for another.

                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.

                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria:

                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                          a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                          a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                          example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

                        All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be

                        the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                        support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                        example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                        of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                        Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                        define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                        field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                        matching.

                        Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                        the following protocols:

                        * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                        * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                        * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match both the SNI and Host header.
                          Note that this does not require the SNI and Host header to be the same.
                          The semantics of this are described in more detail below.

                        To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                        implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                        hostnames within the application protocol.

                        Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                        reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                        status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                        request because it appears to have been misdirected.

                        To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                        the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                        Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:

                        * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                          the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                        * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                          does not match the Host:
                            * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                              421.
                            * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                              404.

                        For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                        `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                        there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                        accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                        documentation.

                        Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                        as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                        both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                            Mode defines the TLS behavior for the TLS session initiated by the client.
                            There are two possible modes:

                            - Terminate: The TLS session between the downstream client and the
                              Gateway is terminated at the Gateway. This mode requires certificates
                              to be specified in some way, such as populating the certificateRefs
                              field.
                            - Passthrough: The TLS session is NOT terminated by the Gateway. This
                              implies that the Gateway can't decipher the TLS stream except for
                              the ClientHello message of the TLS protocol. The certificateRefs field
                              is ignored in this mode.

                        Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                        combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                        and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                        a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                        AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                        resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                        attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                        Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                        successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                        for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                        attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.

                        measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

          GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
          to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
          Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
          where matching requests will be routed.

          GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
          following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation
          supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an
          implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
          unless explicitly indicated.

          Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST
          accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. via
          ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
          "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
          "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
          with an upgrade from HTTP/1.

          Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
          support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
          https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
          upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
          (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
          does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"
          for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".
          Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from
          HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.

                description: |-
                  Hostnames defines a set of hostnames to match against the GRPC
                  Host header to select a GRPCRoute to process the request. This matches
                  the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                  1. IPs are not allowed.
                  2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                     label MUST appear by itself as the first label.

                  If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and GRPCRoute, there
                  MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be
                  attached to the Listener. For example:

                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                    `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
                    hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.

                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any
                  GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                  GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                  `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.

                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                  match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by
                  the implementation. The implementation MUST raise an 'Accepted' Condition
                  with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                  If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
                  Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other
                  type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is
                  non-empty, then the implementation MUST accept exactly one of these two
                  routes, determined by the following criteria, in order:

                  * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                  * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                    "{namespace}/{name}".

                  The rejected Route MUST raise an 'Accepted' condition with a status of
                  'False' in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                     1. IPs are not allowed.
                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                        label must appear by itself as the first label.

                    Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating

                    alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric

                  ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                  to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                  allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                  the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                  namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                  namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                  and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                  create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                  Route.

                  There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                  resources.

                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                  Some examples:

                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                    same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                    object must also set `port`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                  merged.

                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                    with "Core" support:

                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.

                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                        differently based on the type of parent resource.

                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                        both specified values.

                        both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                        interpreted.

                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                    GRPCRouteRule defines the semantics for matching a gRPC request based on
                    conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                    an API object (backendRefs).

                    backendRefs:
                      description: |-
                        BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                        sent.

                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                        how many are invalid.

                        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                        specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                        receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.

                        See the GRPCBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                        GRPCBackendRef invalid.

                        When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, `UNAVAILABLE` statuses MUST be returned for
                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                        MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.

                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
                        Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                                    Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                    types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                    - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                      implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.

                                    - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                      are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                    - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                      In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                      implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                      conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                      is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                      "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                    Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                    extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                    MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                    that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                        Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                        this rule.

                        The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                        This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.

                        Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

                        - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations that support
                          GRPCRoute.
                        - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                        - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                          implementations.

                        Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                        indicated in the filter.

                        If an implementation cannot support a combination of filters, it must clearly
                        document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                        filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                        `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                        this configuration error.

                              RequestMirror defines a schema for a filter that mirrors requests.
                              Requests are sent to the specified destination, but responses from
                              that destination are ignored.

                              This filter can be used multiple times within the same rule. Note that
                              not all implementations will be able to support mirroring to multiple
                              backends.

                                  Mirrored requests must be sent only to a single destination endpoint

                                  If the referent cannot be found, this BackendRef is invalid and must be
                                  dropped from the Gateway. The controller must ensure the "ResolvedRefs"
                                  condition on the Route status is set to `status: False` and not configure
                                  this backend in the underlying implementation.

                                  If there is a cross-namespace reference to an *existing* object
                                  that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                        if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

                        For example, take the following matches configuration:

                        matches:

                        ```

                        For a request to match against this rule, it MUST satisfy
                        EITHER of the two conditions:

                        - service of foo.bar AND contains the header `version: 2`
                        - service of foo.bar.v2

                        See the documentation for GRPCRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                        match conditions to be ANDed together.

                        If no matches are specified, the implementation MUST match every gRPC request.

                        Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from GRPCRoutes
                        MUST prioritize rules based on the following criteria, continuing on
                        ties. Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes.
                        Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:

                        * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                        * Characters in a matching hostname.
                        * Characters in a matching service.
                        * Characters in a matching method.
                        * Header matches.

                        If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                        * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                          "{namespace}/{name}".

                        If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
                        matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
                        the above criteria.

                  Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                  each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                  first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                  route or gateway is modified.

                  Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                  of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                  can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                  responsible for.

                  A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                        status conditions and listener status.

                        If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                        Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                        then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                        Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                        Gateway, and why.

                        A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                        rules is implemented by the Gateway.

                        There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                        due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:

                        controllerName field on GatewayClass.

                        Example: "example.net/gateway-controller".

                        The format of this field is DOMAIN "/" PATH, where DOMAIN and PATH are
                        valid Kubernetes names
                        (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).

                        Controllers MUST populate this field when writing status. Controllers should ensure that
                        entries to status populated with their ControllerName are cleaned up when they are no
                        longer necessary.

                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                  Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                  header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                  MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                  performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                  configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.

                  Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                  hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                  1. IPs are not allowed.
                  2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                     label must appear by itself as the first label.

                  If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                  must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                  attached to the Listener. For example:

                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                    `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                    all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                    not match.

                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                  HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                  HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                  `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                  match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                  implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                  `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                  In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                  overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                  be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:

                  * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                  * Characters in a matching hostname.

                  If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                  HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                  ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                  to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                  allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                  the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                  namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                  namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                  and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to

                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                  resources.

                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                  Some examples:

                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                    same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                    object must also set `port`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                  merged.

                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                    with "Core" support:

                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                        differently based on the type of parent resource.

                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.

                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                        interpreted.

                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                    HTTPRouteRule defines semantics for matching an HTTP request based on
                    conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                    an API object (backendRefs).

                      description: |-
                        BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                        sent.

                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                        how many are invalid.

                        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                        specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                        receive a 500 status code.

                        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                        HTTPBackendRef invalid.

                        When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                        MUST receive a 500 status code.

                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                        choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                        When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
                        implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
                        If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
                        MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                        header in the response.

                                        If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the
                                        following rules:

                                        * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                          port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                          and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                          well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                        * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                          Listener port.

                                        Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                        header in the following cases:

                                        * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                        * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                    Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                    types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                    - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                      implementations must support core filters.

                                    - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                      are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                    - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                      specific vendors.
                                      In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                      implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                      conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                      is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                      "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                    Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                    extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                    MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                    that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                    Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                    must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                    Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                    Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                    Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no

                        Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                        this rule.

                        Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                        they are specified.

                        Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                        any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
                        choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                        that behavior.

                        To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                        consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                        in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                        a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                        "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.

                        Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

                        - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                        - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                        - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                          implementations.

                        Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                        indicated in the filter.

                        All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                        URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                        implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                        document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                        filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                        `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                        this configuration error.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                        Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                        HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                        if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

                        For example, take the following matches configuration:

                        ```
                        matches:
                        - path:
                            value: "/foo"
                          headers:
                          - name: "version"
                            value: "v2"
                        - path:
                            value: "/v2/foo"
                        ```

                        For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                        EITHER of the two conditions:

                        - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                        - path prefix of `/v2/foo`

                        See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                        match conditions that should be ANDed together.

                        If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                        path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                        HTTP request.

                        Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                        MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                        ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                        given to the match having:

                        * "Exact" path match.
                        * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                        * Method match.
                        * Largest number of header matches.
                        * Largest number of query param matches.

                        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.

                        If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                        * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                          "{namespace}/{name}".

                        If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                        to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                        criteria.

                        When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                        parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                    Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                    exact string match. (See
                                    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                                    If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                    purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                    capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                    match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                    as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                    the Gateway API.

                                    Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                    themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                            for example, if automatic retries are supported.

                            The value of BackendRequest must be a Gateway API Duration string as defined by
                            GEP-2257.  When this field is unspecified, its behavior is implementation-specific;
                            when specified, the value of BackendRequest must be no more than the value of the
                            Request timeout (since the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout).

                        request:
                          description: |-
                            Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                            If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                            MUST return a timeout error.

                            For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                            `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                            to complete.

                            Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                            completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                            instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                            the timeout can be set.

                            This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                            as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                            request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                            initiated by the client.

                            The value of Request is a Gateway API Duration string as defined by GEP-2257. When this
                            field is unspecified, request timeout behavior is implementation-specific.

                  Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                  each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                  first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                  route or gateway is modified.

                  Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                  of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                  can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                  responsible for.

                  A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                        If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                        Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,

                        Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                        Gateway, and why.

                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                  Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                  header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                  MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                  performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                  configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.

                  Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                  hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                  1. IPs are not allowed.
                  2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                     label must appear by itself as the first label.

                  If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                  must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                  attached to the Listener. For example:

                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                    `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                    all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                    not match.

                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                  HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                  HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                  `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                  match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                  implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                  `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                  In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                  overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                  be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:

                  * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                  * Characters in a matching hostname.

                  If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                  HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                    Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches

                     1. IPs are not allowed.

                  ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                  to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                  allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                  the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                  namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                  namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                  and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                  create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                  Route.

                  There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                  resources.

                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                  Some examples:

                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                    same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                    object must also set `port`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                  merged.

                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.

                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                        Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                        differently based on the type of parent resource.

                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                        document how/if Port is interpreted.

                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                        both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                        interpreted.

                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    HTTPRouteRule defines semantics for matching an HTTP request based on
                    conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                    an API object (backendRefs).

                    backendRefs:
                      description: |-
                        BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                        sent.

                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                        how many are invalid.

                        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                        specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                        receive a 500 status code.

                        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                        HTTPBackendRef invalid.

                        When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                        MUST receive a 500 status code.

                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                        choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                        When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
                        implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
                        If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
                        MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                            outside of the cluster and as such are difficult to reason about in

                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                        header in the response.

                                        If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the
                                        following rules:

                                        * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                          port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                          and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                          well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                        * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                          Listener port.

                                        Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                        header in the following cases:

                                        * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                        * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                    Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                    types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                    - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                      implementations must support core filters.

                                    - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                      are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                    - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                      specific vendors.
                                      In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                      implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                      conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                      is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                      "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                    Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                    extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                    MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                    that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                    Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                    must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                    Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                    Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                    Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                                  enum:
                                  - RequestHeaderModifier

                                            ReplaceFullPath specifies the value with which to replace the full path

                                          description: |-
                                            ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                        Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                        this rule.

                        Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                        they are specified.

                        Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                        any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
                        choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                        that behavior.

                        To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                        consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                        in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                        a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                        "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.

                        Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

                        - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                        - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                        - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                          implementations.

                        Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                        indicated in the filter.

                        All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                        URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                        implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                        document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                        filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                        `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                        this configuration error.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                        Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                        HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                        if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

                        For example, take the following matches configuration:

                        ```
                        matches:
                        - path:
                            value: "/foo"
                          headers:
                          - name: "version"
                            value: "v2"
                        - path:
                            value: "/v2/foo"
                        ```

                        For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                        EITHER of the two conditions:

                        - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                        - path prefix of `/v2/foo`

                        See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                        match conditions that should be ANDed together.

                        If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                        path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                        HTTP request.

                        Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                        MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                        ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                        given to the match having:

                        * "Exact" path match.
                        * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                        * Method match.
                        * Largest number of header matches.
                        * Largest number of query param matches.

                        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.

                        If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                        * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                          "{namespace}/{name}".

                        If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                        to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                        criteria.

                        When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                        parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                    case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered

                                    exact string match. (See
                                    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                                    If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                    purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                    capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                    match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                    as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                    the Gateway API.

                                    Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                    themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                            BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
                            to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
                            sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.

                            Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                            completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                            instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                            the timeout can be set.

                            An entire client HTTP transaction with a gateway, covered by the Request timeout,
                            may result in more than one call from the gateway to the destination backend,
                            for example, if automatic retries are supported.

                            The value of BackendRequest must be a Gateway API Duration string as defined by
                            GEP-2257.  When this field is unspecified, its behavior is implementation-specific;
                            when specified, the value of BackendRequest must be no more than the value of the
                            Request timeout (since the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout).

                          description: |-
                            Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                            If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                            MUST return a timeout error.

                            For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                            `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                            to complete.

                            Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                            completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                            instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                            the timeout can be set.

                            This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                            as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                            request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                            initiated by the client.

                  Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                  each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                  first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                  route or gateway is modified.

                  Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                  of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                  can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                  responsible for.

                  A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                        status conditions and listener status.

                        If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                        Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                        then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                        Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                        Gateway, and why.

                        A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                        rules is implemented by the Gateway.

                        There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                        due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:

                        * The Route refers to a nonexistent parent.

                            to the local namespace of the Route.

                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.
                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

          ReferenceGrant identifies kinds of resources in other namespaces that are
          trusted to reference the specified kinds of resources in the same namespace
          as the policy.

          Each ReferenceGrant can be used to represent a unique trust relationship.
          Additional Reference Grants can be used to add to the set of trusted
          sources of inbound references for the namespace they are defined within.

          All cross-namespace references in Gateway API (with the exception of cross-namespace
          Gateway-route attachment) require a ReferenceGrant.

          ReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert
          which cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that
          support ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have
          no grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access
          that the grant allowed.
